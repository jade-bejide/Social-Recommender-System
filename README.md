# Social-Recommender-System

## Reforming Streaming Services Customer Experience

### What's the Problem?
Streaming and video entertainment platforms (such as YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime etc) use a range of recommendation algorithms to optimise user's browsing experience. However, the problem with these techniques is that they sometimes fail to consider the demand for customising who a user wishes to include as part of collaborative filtering techniques to produce recommendations regardless of how similar they are with other users available on a system.

### Problem Solution
Most people like to get movie or television show recommendations through word-of-mouth/face-to-face/any other communication channel. This project will automate this process. It aims to evaluate whether a user's ability to customise their nearest neighbours by allowing users to follow other users on the system will increase recommendation satisfaction. User's followings who are most similar to that user will have the most significant influence on user's recommendations

#### Summarised Aims

* Increase Recommendations Satisfaction
* Allows users to customise the extent to which other user's data influences their own recommendation by allowing users to 'follow' other users on the system.
